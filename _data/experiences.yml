    During the first two years of my PhD at the Erasmus Medical Center I was part of the [NWO-ODEX](https://www.dtls.nl/categorie/odex/) project, led by Barend Mons.
    The goals of this project were to 1) to solve a number of industry relevant life-science use cases using a knowledge graph, and 2)
    to develop a FAIR infrastructure, which supports transforming data to the FAIR format. 
  - The results are currently being written up, and will be published as soon as possible.

    During my 1+ year at the VUA I was part of the Knowledge Representation and Reasoning group, under the supervision of Annette ten Teije and Frank van Harmelen.
    I was assigned to the [Eureca](www.eurecaproject.eu) project, an EU FP7 project, where I worked on the contextualization of patient data.
    The goal was to use patient data to search relevant information based on a small number of clinical use cases.
    A simple web interface was developed, with as a first step pre-programmed use cases, and a theoretical underpinning for a more flexible approach, for which there was no time. 
    As contributions to the Eureca project I wrote two chapters of deliverables, and contributed to many more.
