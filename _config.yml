summary: 'I'm currently a researcher at the Erasmus University Medical Center, at the Medical Informatics department.'
'My PhD focusses on using biomedical knowledge graphs to support data analyses and biomedical research in general.'
'Knowledge extracted from biomedical literature and datasets are semantically integrated with each other into a knowledge graph' 
', after which this comprehensive body of biomedical knowledge is used for knowledge intensive tasks such as identifying migraine biomarkers to predicting the efficacy of drugs.'
'The elements within these knowledge graphs consist of subject-predicate-object triples, along with the provenance of this triple.'
'Triples also form the basic elements of the semantic web. However, while the semantic web adheres to specific standards (e.g. URI\'s), knowledge graphs do not necessarily adhere to these standards.'
'Our most recent research efforts have led us to analyze the complex data extracted from knowledge graphs with machine learning.'
'I have collaborated within both european as well as national research projects, i.e. the EU FP7 Eureka project, and the NWO ODEX project.'
